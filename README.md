### New Computer Vision skills, usages and importance

1. **OpenCV basics** (loading, storing, converting channels, cropping and plotting images): important to be fluent in these tasks for all further CV work
2. **Drawing shapes** (lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, poligons, text, custom fonts, overlays): useful for many tasks, such as creating masks and drawing lines when detecting patterns in images or video
3. **Color spaces** (splitting and merging color channels, HSV): useful for changing the hue/saturation/value of an image, or enhancing a particular color channel, as well as brightening and darkening images
4. **Working with video** (opening up a video capture and using the webcam or a video file): essential when working with any kind of video.
5. **Affine transformation** (translation, rotation, scaling, upsampling/downsampling images): important preprocessing steps
6. **Image pyramids** (gaussian, laplacian): for image blending
7. **Bitwise operations** (AND, OR, NOT, XOR): useful for masking
8. **Blurring and sharpening** (gaussian blur, median blur, bilateralFilter...): for preprocessing to eliminate noise or enhance features
9. **Binarization (thresholding)** (binary, binary inverted, adaptive thresholding, etc): very important when we want just the light or the dark areas in the image
10. **Morphological transformations** (opening - erosion followed by dilation, closing - dilation, then erosion): for noise removal
11. **Edge detection and perspective**: for example for aligning skewed images of documents
12. **Contours** (detecting and sorting edges of objects, approximation, convex hull, fitting rectangle/ellipsis, minimum enclosing circle/triangle, contour shape matching, line detection, Hough lines, circle detection): useful for object detection
13. **Object detection** (template matching, corners, (SIFT, SURF, FAST,) ORB, HAAR cascades: detect certain features in objects, such as patterns or facial features, and can match them to new images

### In-class contributions
